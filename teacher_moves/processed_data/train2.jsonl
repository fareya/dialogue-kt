I started by assuming that the computer costs x dollars. Then I added the cost of the fridge, which is x + $500, and the cost of the TV, which is $600. That gave me a total cost of x + $1100. Then, I set up an equation using the given information that the total budget is $1600, so x + $500 + $600 = $1600.

I forgot to subtract the cost of the TV from the total budget. So if we subtract the $600 for the TV, then the total budget is $1600 - $600 = $1000.
