So now what do you think how many cars out of 300 are there without any kind of tickets or passes?", "teacher_move_type": "focus", "student_move": " There are 225 cars with valid tickets and 45 cars with permanent passes, so 300-225-45 = 30 cars are in the parking lot without any kind of tickets or passes."}
