I started by realizing that Laura needs to buy 2 pairs of window treatments (sheers and drapes) for each window, so for 3 windows, she needs to buy 6 pairs of window treatments. Then, I calculated the cost of each pair of sheers and drapes. The cost of each pair of sheers is $40.00, so 6 pairs will cost 40 x 6 = $240.00. The cost of each pair of drapes is $60.00, so 6 pairs will cost 60 x 6 = $360.00. Finally, I added the cost of the sheers and drapes together to get the total cost for all the window treatments, which is 240 + 360 = $600.00.", "future_teacher_move_type": "probing"}

Next, I used the fact that in 5 years, Matt will be twice James' age to figure out Matt's current age. I let x be Matt's current age and set up the equation 2(x+5) = 35. I then expanded the left side of the equation to get 2x+10 = 35. After subtracting 10 from both sides, I got 2x = 25.

I started by calculating the number of coconut trees in Rohan's farm. There are 20 square meters and each square meter has 2 trees, so the total number of trees is 20 x 2 = 40. Then I calculated the number of coconuts that can be harvested in 6 months. Each tree yields 6 coconuts every 3 months, so in 6 months there will be 6 x 4 = 24 coconuts per tree. Multiplying this by the total number of trees gives us 40 x 24 = 960 coconuts. Finally, I multiplied the total number of coconuts by the price per coconut, which is $0.50. This gives us 960 x $0.50 = $480.", "future_teacher_move_type": "probing"}

To do this, I need to calculate the total number of triangles and rectangles that were eaten, and then multiply that number by 2, since each sandwich piece requires 2 slices of bread. So I calculated that there were 10 cucumber sandwiches, each cut into 4 triangles, so that's 10 x 4 = 40 cucumber sandwich triangles in total. Then I calculated that there were 8 egg sandwiches, each cut into 2 rectangles, so that's 8 x 2 = 16 egg sandwich rectangles in total. Then I added those two numbers together to get the total number of sandwich pieces that were eaten, which was 40 + 12 = 52 sandwich pieces in total. Since each sandwich piece requires 2 slices of bread, I multiplied 52 x 2 = 104 slices of bread. So the answer is 104 slices of bread.", "future_teacher_move_type": "focus"}
